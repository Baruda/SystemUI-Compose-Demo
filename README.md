# SystemUI Compose Demo

A complete, production-quality recreation of core Android System UI features built entirely in **Jetpack Compose**.

This project was created to deeply understand Google Android System UI architecture – reactive patterns, gesture handling, state management, and modern Compose migration.

## Features
- Reactive pull-down **notification shade** with spring physics animation
- **Quick Settings** panel with debounced tile clicks
- **Keyguard** (lock screen) with widgets and biometric unlock simulator
- **Heads-up notifications** with auto-dismiss
- **Navigation bar** (gesture pill + 3-button mode)
- **Full Recents screen** with task cards
- **Split-screen multitasking**
- **Volume** and **Power menus**
- **Material You** dynamic theming
- **Edge-to-edge** display
- Accessibility support (semantics, content descriptions)
- Unit and Compose UI tests

Built with Kotlin, Coroutines, StateFlow/SharedFlow, and Compose best practices.

## Why This Project?
To master platform-level Android engineering – the kind of code that ships to billions of devices.
